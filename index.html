    <h1 class = "title">Matthew's Guide of Storytelling</h1>
    <h3 class = "">Storytelling is an artform. 
        <br>It's spellbinding, mesmuerizing, and a major entertainer in the world. Without
        <br>stories, there is trouble understanding the world, connecting with others, and giving meaning to our
        <br> experiences. They teach us lessons, morals, empathy, and how to become greater human beings. They
        <br> keep us occupied and enthralled throughout the experience, and without them, life would be a lot more </h3>
        <h2>BORING.</h2>

            I am a writer of stories. 
            <br>As a writer, how am I supposed to write a story that is somehow interesting to someone else
            when they read it? <br>Practice makes permanent. The more you write, the better you get at it. Same goes for reading, sports,
            <br>and practically anything you set your mind to. Reading more stories helps as well because it gives you a look at proffesional
            <br>writing, and it can give you ideas of your own to implement into your own stories. The best time to write or tell a story is
            <br>when you feel most inspired and most enthralled to do so. When an idea comes to your mind, that's a good time to start
            <br>writing or plotting down that idea. Whenever you want to, you should.

            Wait, how the heck do I know that I'm a storyteller? What if I don't like to write, or read, or any of that stupid stuff?
            <br>Well, you'll likely know based on your thoughts or inspirations. If you like sports, and you only ever like watching
            <br>TV instead of reading, and you don't like reading, likely you're just an enjoyer of stories and not a maker of them.
            <br>The best way to know is to base it on your interests. If you like to read, write, and you like the thrill of sharing your
            <br>ideas to other people; most likely you are a storyteller. If you have sudden inspirations or ideas for a story, then
            <br> that is probably the biggest indication of your brain telling you that you have a craving for telling stories.
            <br><br> The way I look at it, life on its own is a story, and the only other way to make more of what you're making as you live
            <br>is to make more stories---and it doesn't have to be writing. Take a hike, smell the flowers, hang out with friends and
            <br> family, read your future kid a book. <br><h1>Do anything to share, express, and live, and that will make your story bigger, better, and above all---beautiful.</h1>
